# Welcome

Welcome. I’m Ahmed Fasih. Welcome to my blog, whose title comes from Professor Richard Hamming’s motto, “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers” ([SIAM](http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=893)).

After enjoying programming for years, I discovered applied math in mid-undergrad. I decided it would be harder, and therefore more interesting, than “just” software engineering. After years of grad school (ABD in electrical engineering from Ohio State), then working in the lovely D.C. metro area, I revised my views and came back to Ohio as a software engineer who just happens to know some things about signal processing and machine learning.

I sling JavaScript, Clojure/Script, Python, Matlab, and C for fun and profit. And when I’m not writing code or applying math, I enjoy studying the languages and literatures of Icelandic, Persian, Chinese, and Japanese civilizations.

I have a wonderful family. Here we are in disguise, circa mid-2015—Emily as Poirot, Alistair as Joseph Steel, Basile as Charlie Chaplain, and Ahmed (me) as Dalí:

“When Cyrus invaded Babylonia, Nabonidus was so busy trying to decipher the contents of the foundation stone of a thirty-two-century-old temple that he never noticed that he was no longer king until he returned to the city one evening and found Cyrus in residence at the new palace. At least that’s the story the black-haired people like to tell. Actually, Nabonidus was captured, imprisoned, freed. He then went back to his digging.” —Gore Vidal, <cite>Creation</cite> (1981)
