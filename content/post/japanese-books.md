## A handbook of common Japanese phrases

*A handbook of common Japanese phrases*,  compiled by Sanseido, translated and adapted by John Brennan. [OhioLink record](https://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b21374702~S0)

John Brennan’s translation for Japanese *learners* of publishing house Sanseido’s book of language etiquette originally intended for Japanese *native speakers* has many common set phrases (highly developed and sometimes lengthy collocations) for

- congratulations,
- condolences,
- making speeches,
- giving gifts,
- addressing people (eleven set phrases for “Have you got a moment?”, seven for “is it all right of I take this seat?”!),
- visiting a sick person,
- leaving,
- making requests,
- consenting to a request,
- refusing a request,
- persuading,
- stating an objection,
- making excuses and denying rumors,
- criticizing (six set phrases for “I’m speechless!”),
- praising,
- reacting to praise,
- expressing thanks,
- apologizing.

That’s part 1, “everyday phrases”. Part 2, “business phrases” continues in this vein. I will turn to this book when I’m further along.
