      <description>Welcome to my blog, whose title comes from Professor Richard Hamming’s motto, “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers” (SIAM).
After enjoying programming for years, I discovered applied math in mid-undergrad. I decided it would be harder, and therefore more interesting, than “just” software engineering. After years of grad school (ABD in electrical engineering from Ohio State), then working in the lovely D.C. metro area, I revised my views and came back to Ohio as a full-stack developer who just happens to know a lot about signal processing, machine learning, and scientific computing.</description>

      <description>Roko Belic’s 2011 documentary film Happy (Hoopla) had many memorable situations but the one I keep returning to is co-housing. Around the 39th minute, the film discusses the system in Denmark, where where several families live on a plot of land or a single building even, where specific duties, amenities, and projects are shared by all co-housers. The film explains the system through a case study of a single mother who describes the Jernstobereit co-house as the “miracle” she was looking for.</description>

      <description>I am very pleased to announce the release of Ebisu and Ebisu.js!
These are are public-domain software libraries intended to be used by quiz or flashcard apps for intelligent, Bayesian quiz scheduling. They are released under the completely free Unlicense, and can be used anywhere by anyone without any conditions 🎆. The underlying algorithm is based on a principled application of Bayesian statistics, and has many nice features compared to existing scheduling algorithms 😁.</description>

      <description>I am very pleased to announce a web app I’ve been working on: KanjiBreak!
It’s a tool to help create new databases for kanji/hanzi decomposition, i.e., kanji break-downs 😉. If you’re familiar with Sino-Japanese writing, you know that a character like 場ba (“place/area”) is made up of
 土 (“ground”) on the left, then 日 (“sun” or “day”) on the top-right, below which we find 一 (“one”, the number) on top of 勿.</description>
